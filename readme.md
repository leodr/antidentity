<br><br>

Antidentity is sort of a password manager that works without storage or syncing.
It generates unique usernames and passwords by hashing a keyphrase with the
domain name of the service you want to use.

It runs entirely in your browser and is contained within the single `index.html`
file, which can be run locally or hosted yourself.
